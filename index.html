		<p class="one-sentence"><i>Others in Mind</i> is a seminar held by Darya von Berner at Caspar-David-Friedrich-Institute Greifswald in 2023.</p> 
		<p class="one-sentence"><i>Others in Mind</i> is a Biotope on top of an upside down garbage can.</p>
		<p class="one-sentence"><i>Others in Mind</i> is Bewegung. Process and Reality (Alfred North Whitehead).</p>
		<p class="one-sentence"><i>Others in Mind</i> is casual talk. </p>
		<p class="one-sentence"><i>Others in Mind</i> is taking care.</p> 
		<p class="multi-sentence"> We found an upside down plastic garbage can that had sat outside for a long time. Life had formed in a little puddle on top of it. We debated on how to show what we found and decided to put the can inside our exhibition space at Caspar-David-Friedrich-Institute so others can marvel, talk and think. To mark our piece as a center of collective attention and means of transition to unreality, we added 3D prints of one of Maik’s sculptures and special lighting.</p>

		<p class="multi-sentence">At the beginning of our Project we were introduced to the notion of always having others in mind during our main week of work. That is why we at first were talking about every group member to get to know them better, even if we thought we knew them already. For that we were introduced to the work of one person by themself and then we described the work to that person and what our perception of them, their way of thinking and working was. We interpreted the work of the others, explaining what we felt when we saw or talked about the other's work. For the first two days our mornings were filled by casually talking, showing each others' work, trying to understand each other. With that method we learned a lot from and about others, but also about ourself. </p>
		<p class="multi-sentence">Elias, Felina and Erhard discovered with Darya that their works are connected by the greater topic of death. A feeling that you do not have words for expressing is represented by the performance and installation by Elias with the living and death of a Tamagotchi, Felinas drawings of path lines that show the path of funerals and the videos about movements in different aspects and its interpretation, for example being crushed by the life forces and the destructive human behavior.</p>
		<p class="multi-sentence">Also the aspect of taking care is important in those and in the work of Maik and Magdalena, as same as Felinas' drawings of path lines about the detours of handicapped persons. Magdalena, who sadly only could come for one day, but showed us a video work about the self and had important thoughts about identity and especially group identity. That was heavily connected to Daryas installtion “SELFI” that was also used in her staging of “Der Kaiser von Atlantis”. 
</p>
		<p class="multi-sentence">Maik, the group’s main artist in the traditional field of art, showed the matter of anthropocene, especially in his painting "Krampf des Atlas".
</p>
		<p class="multi-sentence">All those aspects should come together in our collective work “Others in Mind”.

		<p class="multi-sentence">On Monday after lunch we were looking for something interesting, took tours and discovered the grounds of the CDFI. Even the students that studied already for a little longer discover new things and became aware of so many details that you most times just walk by in your all day life. Besides colonies of firebugs in the backyard and a big nest of wasps, a bike in a tree, a old printing machine, a cable seeming to grow out of a tree, a not well known special access for handicapped people and Maik resting between his work, warming himself on freshly burned ceramics in a workshop we discovered our object that would be our main focus: A trash bin put upside down  with a newly made world on its top, a biotop full of new life.
